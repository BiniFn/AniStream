## 🧱 Architecture

AniWays is built around four core services:

| Service          | Path         | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API Server**   | `cmd/api`    | REST API handling authentication, library, and metadata |
| **Proxy Server** | `cmd/proxy`  | Dedicated HLS streaming proxy                           |
| **Worker**       | `cmd/worker` | Background processor for scraping and sync jobs         |
| **Web Frontend** | `web/`       | SvelteKit UI for users                                  |

### Tech Stack

- GraphQL (AniList)
- JWT + OAuth2 authentication

**Frontend**

- SvelteKit + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS + Shadcn-Svelte
- Vite build system

**Infra**

- Docker-based development
- Database migrations with `golang-migrate`
- Background tasks with cron jobs

## 🧰 Worker CLI

The worker service includes CLI tools for scraping and maintenance:

```bash
# Run worker in daemon mode
./worker

# Scraping operations
./worker scrape recently-updated      # Fetch 40 most recent anime
./worker scrape all-recently-updated  # Fetch all recent anime
./worker scrape full-seed             # Complete database seed (A–Z)

# Library sync operations
./worker library retry-failed         # Retry failed syncs

# Auth management
./worker auth refresh-tokens          # Refresh OAuth tokens
```

## ⚙️ Local Development

### Prerequisites

```bash
make setup
```

This command installs dependencies, generates code, starts containers, and configures your local environment automatically.

### Running services

```bash
# Start API server
make dev-api
# Start Proxy server
make dev-proxy
# Start Worker
make dev-worker
# Start Frontend
cd web && bun run dev
```
